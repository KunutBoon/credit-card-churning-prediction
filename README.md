## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to illustrate my understanding in Data Science along with my traditional working approaches for developing the predictive ML model following the Data Science process. The problem definition of this project is related to Credit Card Churning, where predictive ML models are built to predict the customer who might stop using credit card for the next consecutive periods. Data provided for this project is in transactional format, which required full process of developing ML model starting from Data Integration to Model Development. Therefore, this project is able to shows my strong understanding and my skills on developing ML model.

## Business Problem
Credit Card Churning is customer behavior which defined by inactivity of all credit cards in each user for 3 consecutive months. This problem is typically solved by using the predictive ML models to classify credit card user who might stop using credit cards using his credit transaction, credit payment, card usage, user demographic, etc. The Credit Card Churning problen for this project, same as typical solution, is also required a Data Scientist to **build a predictive model and predict customer credit card churning signals for the next three months**.
